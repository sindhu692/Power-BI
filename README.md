Pharmaceutical Sales & Customer Insights Dashboard

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing pharmaceutical sales data to uncover meaningful insights related to sales performance, customer behavior, profitability, and regulatory compliance. Using Power BI, raw sales data is transformed into an interactive dashboard that supports data-driven business decisions.

🎯 Objective

    - To build a comprehensive analytics solution that helps stakeholders:
    
    - Monitor overall sales performance
    
    - Identify top-selling and under-performing drugs
    
    - Understand customer demographics and buying behavior
    
    - Analyze profitability and cost efficiency
    
    - Track regulatory compliance impact on sales

❗ Problem Statement

    - Pharmaceutical companies handle large volumes of sales and customer data but often lack:
    
    - Clear visibility into revenue and profit trends
    
    - Segmented customer insights
    
    - Drug-level performance tracking
    
    - Time-based sales trend analysis
    
    - This dashboard addresses these gaps by providing centralized, visual, and actionable insights.

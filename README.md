Pharmaceutical Sales & Customer Insights Dashboard

📌 Project Overview

        This project focuses on analyzing pharmaceutical sales data to uncover meaningful insights related to sales performance, customer behavior, profitability, and regulatory compliance. Using Power BI, raw sales data is transformed into an interactive dashboard that supports data-driven business decisions.

🎯 Objective

    To build a comprehensive analytics solution that helps stakeholders:
    
    Monitor overall sales performance
    
    Identify top-selling and under-performing drugs
    
    Understand customer demographics and buying behavior
    
    Analyze profitability and cost efficiency
    
    Track regulatory compliance impact on sales

    Clear visibility into revenue and profit trends
    
    Segmented customer insights
    
    Drug-level performance tracking
    
    Time-based sales trend analysis
    
    This dashboard addresses these gaps by providing centralized, visual, and actionable insights.
